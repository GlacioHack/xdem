Non-stationarity of elevation measurement errors
================================================

Digital elevation models have a precision that can vary with terrain and instrument-related variables. However, quantifying
this precision is complex and non-stationarities, i.e. variability of the measurement error, has rarely been
accounted for, with only some studies that used arbitrary filtering thresholds on the slope or other variables (see :ref:`intro`).

Quantifying the non-stationarities in elevation measurement errors is essential to use stable terrain as a proxy for
assessing the precision on other types of terrain (Hugonnet et al., in prep) and allows to standardize the measurement
errors to reach a stationary variance, an assumption necessary for spatial statistics (see :ref:`spatialstats`).

Here, we show an example in which we identify terrain-related non-stationarities for a DEM difference at Longyearbyen.
We quantify those non-stationarities by `binning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning>`_ robustly
in N-dimension using :func:`xdem.spatialstats.nd_binning` and applying a N-dimensional interpolation
:func:`xdem.spatialstats.interp_nd_binning` to estimate a numerical function of the measurement error and derive the spatial
distribution of elevation measurement errors of the difference of DEMs.

**Reference**: `Hugonnet et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03436-z>`_, applied to the terrain slope
and quality of stereo-correlation (Equation 1, Extended Data Fig. 3a).

# We identify clearly that the two variables have an independent effect on the precision, with

# - *high curvatures and flat slopes* that have larger errors than *low curvatures and flat slopes*
# - *steep slopes and low curvatures* that have larger errors than *low curvatures and flat slopes* as well
#
# We also identify that, steep slopes (> 40Â°) only correspond to high curvature, while the opposite is not true, hence
# the importance of mapping the variability in two dimensions.
#
# Now we need to account for the non-stationarities identified. For this, the simplest approach is a numerical
# approximation i.e. a piecewise linear interpolation/extrapolation based on the binning results.
# To ensure that only robust statistic values are used in the interpolation, we set a ``min_count`` value at 30 samples.

# The output is an interpolant function of slope and curvature that we can use to estimate the elevation measurement

# The same function can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of the elevation measurement error over the area:
