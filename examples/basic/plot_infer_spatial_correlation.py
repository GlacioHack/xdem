Spatial correlation of errors
=============================

Digital elevation models have errors that are spatially correlated due to instrument or processing effects. Here, we
rely on a non-stationary spatial statistics framework to estimate and model spatial correlations in elevation error.
We use a sum of variogram forms to model this correlation, with stable terrain as an error proxy for moving terrain.

# Then, we run the pipeline for inference of elevation heteroscedasticity from stable terrain (*Note: we pass a*
# ``random_state`` *argument to ensure a fixed, reproducible random subsampling in this example*). We ask for a fit with
# a Gaussian model for short range (as it is passed first), and Spherical for long range (as it is passed second):

# The first output corresponds to the dataframe of the empirical variogram, by default estimated using Dowd's estimator
# and the circular sampling scheme of ``skgstat.RasterEquidistantMetricSpace`` (Fig. S13 of Hugonnet et al. (2022)). The
# ``lags`` columns is the upper bound of spatial lag bins (lower bound of first bin being 0), the ``exp`` column is the
# "experimental" variance value of the variogram in that bin, the ``count`` the number of pairwise samples, and
# ``err_exp`` the 1-sigma error of the "experimental" variance, if more than one variogram is estimated with the
# ``n_variograms`` parameter.
df_empirical_variogram

# %%
# The second output is the dataframe of optimized model parameters (``range``, ``sill``, and possibly ``smoothness``)
# for a sum of gaussian and spherical models:
df_model_params

# The third output is the spatial correlation function with spatial lags, derived from the variogram:
for spatial_lag in [0, 100, 1000, 10000, 30000]:
    print(
        "Errors are correlated at {:.1f}% for a {:,.0f} m spatial lag".format(
            spatial_corr_function(spatial_lag) * 100, spatial_lag
        )
    )

# We can plot the empirical variogram and its model on a non-linear X-axis to identify the multi-scale correlations.

# This pipeline will not always work optimally with default parameters: variogram sampling is more robust with a lot of
# samples but takes long computing times, and the fitting might require multiple tries for forms and possibly bounds
# and first guesses to help the least-squares optimization. **To learn how to tune more parameters and use the
# subfunctions, see the gallery example:** :ref:`sphx_glr_advanced_examples_plot_variogram_estimation_modelling.py`!
