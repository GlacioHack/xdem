Estimation and modelling of spatial variograms
==============================================

Digital elevation models have errors that are often `correlated in space <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis#Spatial_auto-correlation>`_.
While many DEM studies used solely short-range `variogram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram>`_ to
estimate the correlation of elevation measurement errors (e.g., `Howat et al. (2008) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GL034496>`_
, `Wang and Kääb (2015) <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs70810117>`_), recent studies show that variograms of multiple ranges
provide larger, more reliable estimates of spatial correlation for DEMs.

Here, we show an example in which we estimate the spatial correlation for a DEM difference at Longyearbyen, and its
impact on the standard error with averaging area. We first estimate an empirical variogram with
:func:`xdem.spatialstats.sample_empirical_variogram` based on routines of `scikit-gstat
<https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat/index.html>`_. We then fit the empirical variogram with a sum of variogram
models using :func:`xdem.spatialstats.fit_sum_model_variogram`. Finally, we perform spatial propagation for a range of
averaging area using :func:`xdem.spatialstats.number_effective_samples`, and empirically validate the improved
robustness of our results using :func:`xdem.spatialstats.patches_method`, an intensive Monte-Carlo sampling approach.

# To quantify the spatial correlation of the data, we sample an empirical variogram.
# The empirical variogram describes the variance between the elevation differences of pairs of pixels depending on their
# distance. This distance between pairs of pixels if referred to as spatial lag.
#
# To perform this procedure effectively, we use improved methods that provide efficient pairwise sampling methods for
# large grid data in `scikit-gstat <https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat/index.html>`_, which are encapsulated
# conveniently by :func:`xdem.spatialstats.sample_empirical_variogram`:
# Dowd's variogram is used for robustness in conjunction with the NMAD (see :ref:`robuststats-corr`).

# *Note: in this example, we add a* ``random_state`` *argument to yield a reproducible random sampling of pixels within
# the grid.*

# %%
# We plot the empirical variogram:
xdem.spatialstats.plot_variogram(df)

# %%
# With this plot, it is hard to conclude anything! Properly visualizing the empirical variogram is one of the most
# important step. With grid data, we expect short-range correlations close to the resolution of the grid (~20-200
# meters), but also possibly longer range correlation due to instrument noise or alignment issues (~1-50 km).
#
# To better visualize the variogram, we can either change the axis to log-scale, but this might make it more difficult
# to later compare to variogram models. # Another solution is to split the variogram plot into subpanels, each with
# its own linear scale. Both are shown below.

# %%
# **Log scale:**
xdem.spatialstats.plot_variogram(df, xscale="log")

# %%
# **Subpanels with linear scale:**
xdem.spatialstats.plot_variogram(df, xscale_range_split=[100, 1000, 10000])

# %%
# We identify:
#   - a short-range (i.e., correlation length) correlation, likely due to effects of resolution. It has a large partial sill (correlated variance), meaning that the elevation measurement errors are strongly correlated until a range of ~100 m.
#   - a longer range correlation, with a smaller partial sill, meaning the part of the elevation measurement errors remain correlated over a longer distance.
#
# In order to show the difference between accounting only for the most noticeable, short-range correlation, or adding the
# long-range correlation, we fit this empirical variogram with two different models: a single spherical model, and
# the sum of two spherical models (two ranges). For this, we use :func:`xdem.spatialstats.fit_sum_model_variogram`, which
# is based on `scipy.optimize.curve_fit <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html>`_:

# %%
# The sum of two spherical models fits better, accouting for the small partial sill at longer ranges. Yet this longer
# range partial sill (correlated variance) is quite small...
#
# **So one could wonder: is it really important to account for this small additional "bump" in the variogram?**
#
# To answer this, we compute the precision of the DEM integrated over a certain surface area based on spatial integration of the
# variogram models using :func:`xdem.spatialstats.neff_circ`, with areas varying from pixel size to grid size.
# Numerical and exact integration of variogram is fast, allowing us to estimate errors for a wide range of areas rapidly.

# The small size of the sampling area against the very large range of the noise implies that we might not verify the

# our analysis, due to the limits of the variogram sampling. In other words, a small part of the variance could be
# fully correlated over a large part of the grid: a vertical bias.
#
# As a first guess for this, let's examine the difference between mean and median to gain some insight on the central

# Our final estimation is now very close to the empirical error estimate.
#
# Some take-home points:
#   1. Long-range correlations are very important to reliably estimate measurement errors integrated in space, even if they have a small partial sill i.e. correlated variance,
#   2. Ideally, the grid must only contain correlation patterns significantly smaller than the grid size to verify second-order stationarity. Otherwise, be wary of small biases of central tendency, i.e. fully correlated measurement errors!
