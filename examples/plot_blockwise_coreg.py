Blockwise coregistration
========================

Often, biases are spatially variable, and a "global" shift may not be enough to coregister a DEM properly.
In the :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_nuth_kaab.py` example, we saw that the method improved the alignment significantly, but there were still possibly nonlinear artefacts in the result.
Clearly, nonlinear coregistration approaches are needed.
One solution is :class:`xdem.coreg.BlockwiseCoreg`, a helper to run any ``Coreg`` class over an arbitrarily small grid, and then "puppet warp" the DEM to fit the reference best.

The ``BlockwiseCoreg`` class runs in five steps:

1. Generate a subdivision grid to divide the DEM in N blocks.
2. Run the requested coregistration approach in each block.
3. Extract each result as a source and destination X/Y/Z point.
4. Interpolate the X/Y/Z point-shifts into three shift-rasters.
5. Warp the DEM to apply the X/Y/Z shifts.
