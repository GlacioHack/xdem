"""
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) coregistration.
=============================================
Some DEMs may for one or more reason be erroneously rotated in the X, Y or Z directions.
Established coregistration approaches like :ref:`coregistration_nuthkaab` work great for X, Y and Z *translations*, but rotation is not accounted for at all.

ICP is one method that takes both rotation and translation into account.
It is however not as good as :ref:`coregistration_nuthkaab` when it comes to sub-pixel accuracy.
Fortunately, ``xdem`` provides the best of two worlds by allowing a combination of the two.

# The results show what we expected:
#
# * ``ICP`` alone handled the rotational offset, but left a horizontal offset as it is not sub-pixel accurate (in this case, the resolution is 20x20m).
# * ``NuthKaab`` barely helped at all, since the offset is purely rotational.
# * ``ICP + NuthKaab`` first handled the rotation, then fit the reference with sub-pixel accuracy.
#
# The last result is an almost identical raster that was offset but then corrected back to its original position!
