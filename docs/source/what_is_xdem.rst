What is xDEM?
=============

*xdem* aims at simplifying the analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEM). This module provides typical post-processing steps such as coregistration, elevation/volume change measurements and error statistics.
As of today, we are a group of research scientists mostly with interests in glaciology, but the tools we're developing are designed for all sort of geoscience applications.

The core concepts behind *xdem* are:

**Ease of use**: Most operations require only a few lines of code. The module was developed with a focus on remote sensing and geoscience applications. 

**Flexibility**: We offer a set of options, rather than favoring a single method. Everyone should be able to contribute to xdem and add to its functionalities.

**Reproducible**: Version-controlled, releases saved with DOI and test-based development ensure our code always performs as expected.
