Welcome to xdem's documentation!
================================
``xdem`` aims to make Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis easy.
Coregistration, subtraction (and volume measurements), and error statistics should be available to anyone with the correct input data.


Simple usage
==================

.. code-block:: python

        import xdem

        dem1 = xdem.DEM("path/to/first_dem.tif")
        dem2 = xdem.DEM("path/to/second_dem.tif")

        difference = dem1 - dem2
