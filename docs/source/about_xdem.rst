About xDEM
==========

xDEM is a set of open-source Python tools to facilitate the postprocessing of DEMs, and more general with georeferenced rasters. It is designed by geoscientists for geoscientists, although currently our group has a strong focus on glaciological applications.

We are not software developers, but we try our best to offer tools that can be useful to a larger group, are well documented and are reliable and maintained. All develpment and maintenance is made on a voluntary basis and we welcome any new contributors. See some information on how to contribute in the dedicated page of our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

The core concepts behind *xdem* are:

**Ease of use**: Most operations require only a few lines of code. The module was developed with a focus on remote sensing and geoscience applications. 

**Modularity**: We offer a set of options, rather than favoring a single method. Everyone should be able to contribute to xdem and add to its functionalities.

**Reproducibility**: Version-controlled, releases saved with DOI and test-based development ensure our code always performs as expected.
