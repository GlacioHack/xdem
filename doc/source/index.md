xDEM aims at making the analysis of digital elevation models **easy**, **modular** and **robust**.

::::

```{important}
:class: margin
xDEM ``v0.1`` is released, with nearly all features planned 4 years ago ðŸŽ‰! We are now adding an **Xarray accessor**, and re-structuring the "Uncertainty" features for 2025. Note the version you are
working on for reproducibility!
```

xDEM is **tailored to perform quantitative analysis that implicitly understands the intricacies of elevation data**,
both from a **georeferencing viewpoint** (vertical referencing, nodata values, projection, pixel interpretation) and
a **statistical viewpoint** (outlier robustness, specificities of 3D alignment and error structure).

It exposes **an intuitive object-based API to foster accessibility**, and strives **to be computationally scalable**
through Dask.

Additionally, through its sister-package [GeoUtils](https://geoutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), xDEM is built on top
of core geospatial packages (Rasterio, GeoPandas, PyProj) and numerical packages (NumPy, Xarray, SciPy) to provide
**consistent higher-level functionalities at the interface of DEMs and elevation point cloud objects**.
