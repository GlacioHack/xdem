xDEM aims at making the analysis of digital elevation models **easy**, **modular** and **robust**.

:::{admonition} Announcement
:class: tip
:class: margin

xDEM `v0.1` is released, with all core features envisioned at creation 4 years ago ðŸŽ‰!

We are **merging efforts with [demcompare](https://github.com/CNES/demcompare)** to combine the best of both tools into one!

We are working on **adding a ``dem`` Xarray accessor** with native Dask support for 2025.
:::

xDEM is **tailored to perform quantitative analysis that implicitly understands the intricacies of elevation data**,
both from a **georeferencing viewpoint** (vertical referencing, nodata values, projection, pixel interpretation) and
a **statistical viewpoint** (outlier robustness, specificities of 3D alignment and error structure).

It exposes **an intuitive object-based API to foster accessibility**, and strives **to be computationally scalable**
through Dask.

Additionally, through its sister-package [GeoUtils](https://geoutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), xDEM is built on top
of core geospatial packages (Rasterio, GeoPandas, PyProj) and numerical packages (NumPy, Xarray, SciPy) to provide
**consistent higher-level functionalities at the interface of DEMs and elevation point cloud objects**.
