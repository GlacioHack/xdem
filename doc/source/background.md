## The people behind xDEM

### Creation

```{margin}
<sup>1</sup>More on our GlacioHack founder at [adehecq.github.io](https://adehecq.github.io/).
```

xDEM was created during the **[GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack) hackathon**, that was initiated by
Amaury Dehecq<sup>1</sup> and took place online on November 8, 2020.

```{margin}
<sup>2</sup>Check-out [glaciology.ch](https://glaciology.ch) on our founding group of VAW glaciology!
```

The initial core development of xDEM was performed by members of the Glaciology group of the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and
Glaciology (VAW) at ETH ZÃ¼rich<sup>2</sup>, with contributions by members of the University of Oslo, the University of Washington, and University
Grenoble Alpes.

### Current team

```{margin}
<sup>3</sup>More on CNES's 3D missions on the [CO3D constellation page](https://cnes.fr/en/projects/co3d).
```

The current lead development team includes **researchers in Earth observation and engineers from
[CNES](https://cnes.fr/en)** (French Space Agency). We specialize in elevation data analysis, for application in Earth 
science or for operational use for 3D satellite missions<sup>3</sup>.

Other volunteer contributors span diverse scientific backgrounds in industry or research. We welcome
any new contributors! See how to contribute on [the dedicated page of our repository](https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Funding acknowledgments

Members of the lead development team acknowledge funding from:
- SNSF grant no. 184634, a MeteoSwiss [GCOS](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/home) project on elevation data analysis for glaciology,
- NASA award 80NSSC22K1094, an [STV](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys/decadal-stv/) project on the fusion of elevation data,
- NASA award 80NSSC20K0995, an [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/) project on the processing of elevation data in the cloud,
- CNES (French Space Agency): ?.

## Mission

```{epigraph}
The core mission of xDEM is to be **easy-of-use**, **modular** and **robust**.

It also attempts to be as **efficient**, **scalable** and **state-of-the-art** as possible.

Finally, as an open source package, it aspires to foster **reproducibility** and **open science**.
```

In details, those mean:

- **Ease-of-use:** all basic operations or methods from published works should only require a few lines of code to be performed;

- **Modularity:** all methods should be fully customizable, to allow both flexibility and inter-comparison;

- **Robustness:** all methods should be tested within our continuous integration test-suite, to enforce that they always perform as expected;

```{note}
:class: margin
**Scalability** is currently being improved towards a first major release ``v1.0``.
```

And, additionally:

- **Efficiency**: all methods should be optimized at the lower-level, to function with the highest performance offered by Python packages;

- **Scalability**: all methods should support both lazy processing and distributed parallelized processing, to work with high-resolution data on local machines as well as on HPCs;

- **State-of-the-art**: all methods should be at the cutting edge of remote sensing science, to provide users with the most reliable and up-to-date tools.

And finally:

- **Reproducibility:** all code should be version-controlled and release-based, to ensure consistency of dependent
  packages and works;

- **Open-source:** all code should be accessible and re-usable to anyone in the community, for transparency and open governance.
