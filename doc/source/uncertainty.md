# Uncertainty analysis

To analyze DEMs, xDEM integrates spatial uncertainty analysis tools from the recent DEM literature,
in particular in [Hugonnet et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2022.3188922) and
[Rolstad et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.3189/002214309789470950). The implementation of these methods relies
partially on the package [scikit-gstat](https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat/index.html) for spatial statistics.

The uncertainty analysis tools can be used to assess the precision of DEMs (see the definition of precision in {ref}`accuracy-precision`).
In particular, they help to:

> - account for elevation heteroscedasticity (e.g., varying precision such as with terrain slope or stereo-correlation),
> - quantify the spatial correlation of errors in DEMs (e.g., native spatial resolution, instrument noise),
> - estimate robust errors for observations analyzed in space (e.g., average or sum of elevation, or of elevation changes),
> - propagate errors between spatial ensembles at different scales (e.g., sum of glacier volume changes).

## Why uncertainty analysis tools?

The precision of elevation data is often reported by a single metric (e.g., $\pm$ 2 m) ignoring heteroscedasticity 
(spatial variability in error), and also often omit spatial correlations of errors entirely.

Depending on the application, those can be of importance:

- Heteroscedasticity: 
- Spatial correlation of errors: For quantative change analysis

### Elevation heteroscedasticity

Elevation data contains significant variability in measurement errors.

xDEM provides tools to **quantify** this variability using explanatory variables, **model** those numerically to
estimate a function predicting elevation error, and **standardize** data for further analysis.

#### Quantify and model heteroscedasticity

Elevation [heteroscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity) corresponds to a variability in
precision of elevation observations, that are linked to terrain or instrument variables.

$$
\sigma_{dh} = \sigma_{dh}(\textrm{var}_{1},\textrm{var}_{2}, \textrm{...}) \neq \textrm{constant}
$$

Owing to the large number of samples of elevation data, we can easily estimate this variability by [binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning) the data and estimating the statistical dispersion (see
{ref}`robuststats-meanstd`) across several explanatory variables using {func}`xdem.spatialstats.nd_binning`.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input, hide-output]
import geoutils as gu
import numpy as np

import xdem

# Load data
dh = gu.Raster(xdem.examples.get_path("longyearbyen_ddem"))
ref_dem = xdem.DEM(xdem.examples.get_path("longyearbyen_ref_dem"))
glacier_mask = gu.Vector(xdem.examples.get_path("longyearbyen_glacier_outlines"))
mask = glacier_mask.create_mask(dh)

slope = xdem.terrain.get_terrain_attribute(ref_dem, attribute=["slope"])

# Keep only stable terrain data
dh.load()
dh.set_mask(mask)
dh_arr = gu.raster.get_array_and_mask(dh)[0]
slope_arr = gu.raster.get_array_and_mask(slope)[0]

# Subsample to run the snipped code faster
indices = gu.raster.subsample_array(dh_arr, subsample=10000, return_indices=True, random_state=42)
dh_arr = dh_arr[indices]
slope_arr = slope_arr[indices]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Estimate the measurement error by bin of slope, using the NMAD as robust estimator
df_ns = xdem.spatialstats.nd_binning(
    dh_arr, list_var=[slope_arr], list_var_names=["slope"], statistics=["count", xdem.spatialstats.nmad]
)
```

```{eval-rst}
.. plot:: code/spatialstats_heterosc_slope.py
    :width: 90%
```

The most common explanatory variables are:

> - the terrain slope and terrain curvature (see {ref}`terrain-attributes`) that can explain a large part of the terrain-related variability in measurement error,
> - the quality of stereo-correlation that can explain a large part of the measurement error of DEMs generated by stereophotogrammetry,
> - the interferometric coherence that can explain a large part of the measurement error of DEMs generated by [InSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar).

Once quantified, elevation heteroscedasticity can be modelled numerically by linear interpolation across several
variables using {func}`xdem.spatialstats.interp_nd_binning`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Derive a numerical function of the measurement error
err_dh = xdem.spatialstats.interp_nd_binning(df_ns, list_var_names=["slope"])
```

### Standardize

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Standardize the data
z_dh = dh_arr / err_dh(slope_arr)
```

To remedy this issue, xDEM provides {func}`xdem.spatialstats.sample_empirical_variogram`, an empirical variogram estimation tool
that encapsulates a pairwise subsampling method described in `skgstat.MetricSpace.RasterEquidistantMetricSpace`.
This method compares pairwise distances between a center subset and equidistant subsets iteratively across a grid, based on
[sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) routines computing pairwise distances of two separate
subsets, as in [scipy.cdist](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html)
(instead of using pairwise distances within the same subset, as implemented in most spatial statistics packages).
The resulting pairwise differences are evenly distributed across the grid and across lag classes (in 2 dimensions, this
means that lag classes separated by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ have an equal number of pairwise differences computed).

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Sample empirical variogram
df_vgm = xdem.spatialstats.sample_empirical_variogram(values=dh, subsample=10, random_state=42)
```

The variogram is returned as a {class}`~pandas.DataFrame` object.

With all spatial lags sampled evenly, estimating a variogram requires significantly less samples, increasing the
robustness of the spatial correlation estimation and decreasing computing time!

#### Model spatial correlations

Once an empirical variogram is estimated, fitting a function model allows to simplify later analysis by directly
providing a function form (e.g., for kriging equations, or uncertainty analysis - see {ref}`spatialstats-errorpropag`),
which would otherwise have to be numerically modelled.

Generally, in spatial statistics, a single model is used to describe the correlation in the data.
In elevation data, however, spatial correlations are observed at different scales, which requires fitting a sum of models at
multiple ranges (introduced in [Rolstad et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.3189/002214309789470950) for glaciology
applications).

This can be performed through the function {func}`xdem.spatialstats.fit_sum_model_variogram`, which expects as input a
`pd.Dataframe` variogram.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Fit sum of double-range spherical model
func_sum_vgm, params_variogram_model = xdem.spatialstats.fit_sum_model_variogram(
    list_models=["Gaussian", "Spherical"], empirical_variogram=df_vgm
)
```
